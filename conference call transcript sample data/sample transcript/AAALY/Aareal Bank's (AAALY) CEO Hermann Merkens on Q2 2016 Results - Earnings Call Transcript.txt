Hello, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Aareal Bank AG second quarter 2016 analyst conference call. At our customer’s request, this call will be recorded. And as a reminder, all participants shall be in listen-only mode and after the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]

And may I now hand you over to Jürgen Junginger, Director of Investor Relations who will begin. Please go ahead.

Jürgen Junginger

Hello. As said, my name is Jürgen Junginger. I'm heading IR with Aareal Bank. I would like to thank that you're joining our 2Q conference call. It will be hosted by our CEO, Hermann Merkens. First, the presentation and later as usual questions.

So please Hermann.

Hermann Merkens

Hello. Good morning, everybody from our Wiesbaden headquarters with sunny weather. Hopefully, it remains for [Technical Difficulty]

So now starting with the presentation, page 3. Short summary on our Q2. Operating profit was EUR120 million, including two one-offs, the announcement of the closing for Q2 of our foreclosed Swedish asset took place as planned and secondly, integration/project costs and investment costs as expected, some EUR30 million, I will come to that in detail in a second. With respect to new business, we saw a very strong quarter with EUR3.5 billion of new business. For the half year, EUR4.4 billion and last but not least, even the Aareon is moving according to plan, with increasing sales revenues and EBIT, which sounds like Aareal 2020 is on track and Aareal as well. And last but not least, but important in those volatile times, we will confirm our 2016 outlook.

Page 4, general environment. The new arrivals here with Brexit and some comment on Turkey. Maybe more important, what we see on the property markets, decreasing transaction volumes compared - the first half 2016 versus first half 2015. In Italy, in contrary, we saw significantly up in Q2 2016 on transaction volumes. From the competition, intense competition as always set, European margins to a certain extent are somewhat bottoming out, but I think that we will see ongoing pressure here onwards to the - on average, margin is bottoming out, if you include Great Britain and rest of Europe. With respect to overall property prices, I would say that we see ongoing increasing property values, especially in Europe, whereas in the US, to a certain extent, I would expect moving forward a kind of plateau far property prices and rent values.

I'm now on page 6, which is Q2 in a glance. Robust margins, declining NCA portfolio, which translates into EUR177 million, net interest income. With respect to early repayments, 2 million above originally pro rata planned. So we are in line with our expectations of EUR35 million. Although I would like to underpin that although the overall transaction volume and property markets went down in the first half 2016, so meaning that our planning for the extraordinary payments have been quite in line with market development so far. Allowance for credit losses, EUR29 million. So, as expected from Q1, we see and expect that we will end up here in our outlook guidance. Net commission income is supported by the business of Aareon. Admin expenses EUR144 million. As already mentioned, some EUR30 million one-offs and operating profit in this sort of line-item. I will comment on that later on. EUR61 million extraordinary profit from Aqvatrium and Fatburenour, higher value Nordic properties. With respect to tax ratios, if we’re moving down to the earnings per share, as always indicated, we are calculating our earnings per share on an yearly average tax ratio of slightly above 31%, according to IFRS accounting rules and 2017 onwards, I would expect the tax ratio of some 33% or 34%, more or less in line with - and depending on the size and share of the US portfolio where we have slightly higher taxation compared to Europe.

Segment performance, it's on page 8. As indicated, Q2 was a very, very strong quarter and I guess some hint during Q1 that some deals slipped over the 31s of March. So, and now they are in our books. The average on balance sheet portfolio moved up, especially towards the end of the quarter, which is for those trying to reconcile some figures, maybe an important hint. Gross margins around 220 basis points in the second quarter. Full first half year, 230 basis points, slightly above our expectations, which are 210 to 220 basis points for the full year. Net result from trading, non-trading, hedge accounting, that includes the EUR61 million Aqvatrium. The rest of it is some EUR6 million day 1 profits and EUR1 million, it’s hedged results, rest of it is some miscellaneous figures. So all in all, I think a very successful quarter, especially from new business and from the margin perspective and last but not least, as expected, but nevertheless quite good results from the Aqvatrium sale.

Consulting services on page 9. As said, Aareon is developing according to plan, feeding into our Aareal 2020 story, which means that we do expect Aareon to be at EUR40 million to EUR45 million level end of 2018 and moving then into 4% per year average growth. All of the initiatives are paying out, meaning the transfer from GES into Wodis Sigma, we saw quite good and strong development for our new products in France and Netherlands and even with digitization, we are moving according to plan. Deposit margins, as you know, are burdening the segment reporting, deposits are EUR9.5 billion. We are paying here for type deposits around zero, and not a negative environment so far as market goes into negative environment, we will clearly follow that.

On page 10, the usual breakup between Aareon Group and Deposits, taking business, I will skip that page. Moving to page 12, more detailed breakdown of our net interest income, EUR177 million. As I said, EUR2 million above our EUR35 million pro rata planning for extraordinary repayments, EUR24 million from our non-core assets, somewhat declining as expected as we are moving down our non-core portfolios, maybe some remarks to the overall market development. So, we've been able to keep our portfolio net interest income on EUR155 million level. The interesting thing on property market is to seek the capital flow composition, which changed significantly in the first half 2016, compared to 2015, especially the net cross-border investments moved significantly down from some EUR40 billion NDS and Europe, down to EUR10 billion, which indicates that especially the cross-border activities went down in the first half 2016. And as I said, the overall transaction volume moved down as well, decreased by some 28% worldwide. With different variations on a year-on-year basis, especially US down 26%, UK especially down 47% and Europe some 28%. Quarter-on-quarter, it looks a little bit better, plus, even Europe, -4 UK and +1 NDS. So I would say that one may see a bottoming out on transaction volumes nominal based on the Q2 level. Hence, the early repayments are according to plan with EUR35 million, but so far can’t reach the extraordinary number EUR70 million from last year, which was backed via the significantly higher transaction volumes.

We will see that how will develop in the future, that is a general picture from first half 2016. Loan loss provisions, EUR29 million, so no further comment here. But just one remark with respect to our Italian portfolio, no additional NPLs here so far. Net commission income, as I said, delivering according to plan, with EUR47 million. I think we are clearly well above for the Q2 2015, so acquisitions are paying out and therefore we are satisfied with the Aareon figures.

Admin expenses on page 15, Q2 figures are including EUR30 million one-offs, more detailed breakdown here. It's EUR22 million for restructuring costs in the WestImmo. We have additional EUR2 million for project costs related to the WestImmo, so there are some EUR6 million for other investment and projects costs and you see here, the Q1 figures as a comparison. One remark to - additional remark to these figures, we are investing in the restructuring, EUR22 million, but I’m expecting payout of this investment in 2018. So 2017 will be somewhat characterized in a way that we are paying the ongoing salaries of the respective employees in 2017 and we will see the full benefit of the EUR22 million in 2018.

Balance sheet structure, capital and funding position on page 17. The RWA development, just two remarks on op risk. We are here on standardized approach, so no major impact from any op risk changes - calculation changes here. Just to remind you, in the RWAs from financials are already very close to standardized approach levels.

On page 18, our capital ratios and maybe some clarifications here as well. What in and what is not in the 13.2% common equity tier 1. So if you do your actuals and compare our 13.2% with others, you may have to include the interim results, which are not recognized in our 13.2%. So if others are including interim results to compare that with other banks, you have to include our interim results and you have clearly to deduct your dividend expectations.

From a regulatory perspective, we have to deduct from our capital the gross before tax, loan loss provisions and here, only additions, we can't match that with releases, so the effect from that deduction of some 0.3%, 0.3%. As a fact, a technical deduction, which is required by the regulator, but clearly kind of influencing the capital ratios. So two major remarks on the capital ratios, a, interim results are not included and, b, from a regulatory perspective, we have to deduct our gross building of loan loss provisions. And last but not least, the third picture I would like to comment on that is the calculation of pension liabilities, we, to a certain extent, have from - for regulatory calculation purposes chosen our interest rate at the so far low point that translates into that the negative effect from the calculation of our pension liabilities, which we see in Q2 is not affecting our common equity tier 1 ratio as we have frozen this calculation at the low point, which was somewhat March 2015 in fact correctly.

So since then, for our regulatory purposes, we have frozen that interest rate. Translating into interest rate is moving down again and we would be effective. It's going up, we keep our conservation approach here. So three remarks to sum it up on capital ratios, no recognition of interim results, deduction of cross new buildings from loan loss provisions and no negative effect from calculation of pension liabilities. I have to say, so far, we will see how the interest rates will go on or move on.

On page 19, stress test results. As you know, we are not a part of the official block of 70% of the bank balance sheet in Europe. Therefore, no official announcement from Aareal, but in clear indication, SREP scenario fully faced. As you see, our results are clearly above our SREP ratio. Our stress test results in the adverse scenario are clearly above our SREP ratio of 8.75% and compared to leverage ratio, we are clearly above 4% leverage ratio, somewhere in the middle between 4 and 5, which I would sum up as quite good result. And if you see the comparison of the shifts here, the main effect as we saw during the last stress test is from other development and the effect from loan loss provisions is hence smaller. We see that - the effect on common equity tier 1 is higher than the effect on the leverage ratio, that is the indication that RWA development in this adverse scenario is driving the common equity tier 1 ratio development and that we do not have so far in that stress test throughout the adverse scenarios.

Balance sheet structure, I think, the pictures as one could expect, it's on page 20, 21, 22, net stable funding ratio quite solid, 23, refinancing situation, we've concentrated on senior unsecured whereas on covered bonds, we are doing acquisitions of WestImmo and on that end. Therefore, no major activities during the first half 2016. 24, the usual picture of our diversified distribution channels. And then I move on the overall portfolio, slide 26, property financing portfolio. Average LTV here is 61%, again, down from 62%. 27, the breakdown of the property financing portfolio.

And 28, so to speak, special slide on UK property financing portfolio and as we indicated, very conservative portfolio with an yield on debt of 10% and average LTV of 57%. No concern, and with respect to Greater London area, we have 55% on hotels, which clearly indicates given all the travel ambitions from outside the UK, into the UK that portfolio should benefit from that trend. Rest of the portfolios are office financing, fully normal development here, fully that property’s - yield on debt on that portfolio is 11%. So I do not see and envisage any stress on our portfolio in the UK.

Italian Performing portfolio. I think first time that we gave a little bit more detail here, but clearly, excluding the EUR832 million NPLs, even under a theoretical stress, we would be below 100% LTV with that portfolio. And as we always indicated, predominant part of that portfolio is in the Greater Rome and Milan area and two very, very, or the vast majority of the portfolio is in the northern part of Italy.

On page 30, Turkey, which consists out of 12 properties, not 200 or something, 12, so we know each and every property very well. 7 hotels, it's a little bit of split between Istanbul and Antalya area, 3 at retail, 2 logistics, no developments. With an yield of debt of 14.9%, which is the current one, I'm feeling quite comfortable with that portfolio and even our hotels on the Antalya area are well booked. Reasoning for that is that the customer background is very well know customer in Turkey, which is owning travel large - big travel agencies and therefore he is able to move feeder business into those hotels. The ones in Istanbul are somewhat backed by very large corporate and as to me here, from that no major headaches on that portfolio, despite the somewhat unexpected development in Turkey.

The property financing portfolio, NPL ratio has stabilized, but I gave the hint back last time, if you’re moving down with our non-core assets, the ratios should react on that to a certain extent.

NPLs in more detail on page 32. And on page 33, last but not least, the NPL portfolio of Italy, staying at 832. I think, 4 million or somewhat down from the last quarter. Not really to mention here, but the more interesting thing is that we now skipped the unclear area of, we don’t know whether it goes into enforcement or in structuring to see that we've been able to close the 19% with and they are now in restructuring as expected. And one little remark on enforcement speed, originally, we calculated some 3 to 4 years in average. Now, this is moving down and improving due to the new legislation in Italy. We will see how far the foreclosures and enforcements in Italy really could be, and the next, the second good message on that is, yes, they are [indiscernible].

Treasury portfolio, no changes here. Last but not least, outlook 2016 on page 36. So we are confirming despite the volatile environment, our outlook for 2016, and again one hand to the average tax ratio, the footnote 2, 31%, as I said. If you do have extraordinary unplanned events, then that tax ratio may change, if the events are planned like we are doing something with WestImmo, yes, we are closing Aqvatrium deal, then we move forward with our full-year planned tax ratio quarter-by-quarter.

So thank you very much and now I’m happy to take your questions. Kind of skipping the conclusion side on page 37 and going directly into your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Benjamin Goy at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open and one second. Sorry about this. Benjamin, sorry, please go ahead with your question now.

Benjamin Goy

Okay, good morning. I think you put a presentation and the additional details on the asset quality in a selected number of countries. I have three more questions. The first on the US growth, obviously you’re growing quite nicely the book, potentially helped by the CMBS turmoil in H1, how do you view that in H2 and going forward. And we also had a couple of German banks issuing US dollar fund, would it be an interesting opportunity for you to reduce funding costs for this portfolio?

Second question is on the UK, I noticed actually that even in euro, your portfolio went up, did you have some interesting opportunities and just have you remained open for business, but just a little more background will be appreciated here. And then lastly on the loan losses, is it still mainly driven by Italy, even so you don't see NPL inflows any more or where did that come from in Q2? Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Okay. Thank you, Benjamin for your questions. If I may start with the first one, yes, indeed, the US capital market is somewhat ineffective, especially the CMBS markets are somewhat struggling for various reasons and hence we see quite nice opportunities in the US business. And secondly, even the major banks are very disciplined in the US, so we do not see so much pressure from the US banks and given those effects, I would think that we will see throughout 2016 at least, but maybe even in 2017, quite good and nice opportunities here.

I think the second question was, sorry, the covered bond, dollar question. So, in general, we are able to do a cross country swap on an attractive basis. So there is no real need to do dollar covered bonds, but there would be an opportunity we clearly would - we would do so and we have actually EUR750 million, US dollar covered bond of spending. So we tap this market, but as you know, we are looking into two things always. The one is the granularity on our asset side and, b, the granularity of our refinancing side, so if there is an opportunity to do something, we will clearly grab that. But it’s no real need so far to do it.

The UK portfolio, we had some switchovers from the first quarter into Q2. We've done especially a new business in hotels and as you said correctly, we are monitoring this market, we are open for new business on an opportunistic basis, given the size of the portfolio, we are not intending to increase that sort of dramatically, but persuading opportunity I think we will grab that opportunity as well. And with respect to the loan loss progressions, there are a lot of small adjustments which are heading up to the total number, so we're talking your about some variations from EUR1 million, the biggest one is EUR4.7 million where we adjusted as they are doing frequently our expectations of closing periods or values. So it is no one effect as a fact it is a lot of adjustments here. And therefore there is no single matter from Italy or other markets which is indicating that we have a lot of new loyalty order that is more that we are adjusting, things which we have already are booked in the segment, or Italian portfolio is the largest contributor, most of it are clearly from Italy but as I said, it’s long list of EUR1 million to EUR2 million or EUR2 million in average.

Benjamin Goy

Then the yield on debt in Italy moved up for the first time in a while, is it a bit too early to call a turnaround and the cash flow of your borrowers or you actually increasingly optimistic from digital starting maybe?

Hermann Merkens

I would say, first of all it is clearly bottoming out so to speak, I wouldn't expect further major deterioration here and as I said during our previous calls, the main thing here that there is a huge disconnect between those buyers which are interested to buy loans for various reasons we discussed and hard assets sales. So hard asset sales are taking place and I think during the last quarter I mentioned the shopping center portfolio across Italy with the cap rate of 5.5%, so it’s not a real so to speak opportunity where you should expect for good assets kind of 8% or something like that but the main thing is for the Italian banks if you're not able to deliver documentation and so on they will continue to maybe to struggle with their portfolio, or if they are forced to do so, have to reflect that with part of this cost.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] While we are waiting for future questions, we will go over to the line of Britta Schmidt at Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Britta Schmidt

I've got three questions please. On the new adjustment in the capital this quarter, can you just confirm that if I look at the [indiscernible] see additions of 37 million in the first half, can you confirm that this is the right number that we’re looking at and can you also confirm that therefore…

Hermann Merkens

Sorry Britta, [indiscernible] question from my side, could you repeat the question because there was some noise in the line. Sorry for that.

Britta Schmidt

My question relates to the adjustment and capital in this quarter for the loan loss provisions, the gross loans provisions, am I right in assuming that this is essentially the number that we are seen [indiscernible] in your interim statement, the gross additions of 37 million for the full half-year that you reflected in this quarterly capital provision. And going forward this will be the quarterly adjustment of that figure and that at the end of the year therefore kind of a bigger profit contribution will offset that because obviously your profit includes these cost additions if you see what I mean, I hope that question is clear. My second question refers to your comment regarding the size of the transactions and when they were bought on, I think I understood that a lot of peers came on at the end of the quarter, am I right in assuming therefore that the outlook for the Q3 net interest income is somewhat better [indiscernible]. And the third question relates again to something on capital, could you give us an idea of the discount rate that is being used for the where the discount has been sovereign and any sort of sensitivity as to from what point onwards we might see an impact on your capital?

Hermann Merkens

So, starting with the first question the simplest answer to that is yes, you are right, in general you have to be exact if you need calculation the EUR37 million, as I said the [indiscernible] little bit more complicated because we have some minor release, it’s not a release but these have full write-on of some loans and we received some payment on the fully written down loans and those payment you can’t use to offset the new loss provisions, but as we’re talking about not that large numbers we could simply deduct the 37 and that should be offset at the end if you do our full calculation and that's the main reason why I mentioned the 7.3 equity increase if you simply would add in your calculation. With respect to the question of new business towards the end of the quarter, yes in general, on the other hand we are increasing authentication efforts, so it’s always a little bit tricky to judge whether this indication result will kick in exactly in Q3 beginning of Q3 not really to be expected because of the holiday season but somewhere in September. But in general I think that you will see kind of fully booked loan book in Q3, hence the net interest income should be supported. And your third question was, sorry if I…

Britta Schmidt

It was on the pension, can you give any idea…

Hermann Merkens

The interest rate for the pensions, we’ve frozen that at 1.45. So we have frozen that on 1.45, so just to give an indication, Q1 [indiscernible] Q2 was 1.88 down to 1.45, which translates into the effect that you see in the OCI, so to speak in general it’s always depending on the average employee who will as well but you could recalculate sensitivity.

Britta Schmidt

[Indiscernible] rate go down further there would be an impact because they are at the 1.45.

Hermann Merkens

That’s why I mentioned it, but as interest rate is interesting one because it is a worldwide composition of AA bonds, it is like market standard as you know, one could argue for and against it, but it is market standard, so it is a really depending on a lot of effect, it’s not just the euro zone.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Jochen Schmitt at Metzler. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.

Jochen Schmitt

I have one question, in your press release you mentioned uncertainty about regulatory initiatives and my question is, could you please provide an update whether your expectations about Aareal’s future capital requirements have changed in recent months that's it.

Hermann Merkens

I don't know whether it would good news or bad news but no change of expectation so far so which is indicating that there is no good news flow on that unfortunately that translates into, yes, the environment is uncertain here and will be uncertain. On the other hand, as I explained with our strategy Aareal 2021, we are following route which should enable us in my scenarios to win and more severe scenarios to go through that changing environment without major changes and address now we have to adjust it to the tier that was there but from an overall portfolio size here, we try to stir that into area end of 2016 but we are able to react either in the one or in the other direction.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of your hand storm and of [indiscernible] of HSBC. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.

Unidentified Analyst

Two questions from me. First of all, your business in H1 is already half or more than half of the upper end of the new business guidance, it’s normally H2 is the stronger one, do you expect more to come in the next quarters, it’s a risk of upward revision of your guidance or whether one off effect in Q2. And secondly regarding your tax rate guidance for 2016, so you changed from 31% underlying to a 31% reported tax rate, which implies that it is basically if we adjust for most of platform being tax free, that this 37% underlying tax rate in ‘16, how do you drop from 37 then to 36, 34 in the next year? Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

If I may start with the new business, as the new business in Q2 was very strong, we are clearly now starting to go into our 2020 strategy which means that we indicate more than you've seen in the last couple of years. So that not necessarily means if you keep our new business on a very high level that we will see on balance sheet effects but there might be off-balance sheet effects as well meaning that the assets on the management could increase over time according to our business strategy. And hence the net income should be supported from the off-balance sheet business as well and as it is not capital intense business. So we are in that respect moving really again according to plan. The tax ratios with one off effect if you exclude the somewhat 37%, 38% in 2016 but as you see all those effects has been included into over estimation of the average 2016 tax ratio of 31%. If I would exclude the one-off of 2016, one would end up in 2016 with 31.8, I have that correctly in my head, 31.8% tax ratio and the shift into 33%, 34% is really caused by the shift into top the US business where we have significantly higher average tax ratio which should be to a certain extent overcompensated by higher gross margins but clearly we are looking at both ends the net income after tax in the respective portfolio and the gross margins as well if you are thinking about portfolio composition. Hence your calculation that the so to speak [indiscernible] tax ratio in 2016 is higher, it’s absolutely correct and therefore I just mentioned the tax ratio excluding one-offs in 2016.

Unidentified Analyst

Sorry, but how does it drop because we expect continued US business, 33%, 34% in ‘17 and ‘18 again and that's my first follow-up.

Hermann Merkens

From 31.2% to your calculation that are one-offs which we have on the taxation in 2016, which we do not think will be repeated in the following years, if you’re going into the normal average tax ratio in 2016 we are on 31.8 average. And therefore we are moving from 31.8 up to 33, 35.

Unidentified Analyst

And secondly, on your Italian portfolio, it’s more than 50% is in the greater Rome, Milan area, we were just wondering where the rest is greater Sicily Napoli area or what is this?

Hermann Merkens

[indiscernible] not in the greater Napoli area but in Napoli which is how should I say, the entire operation is long-term leased to the world's largest country by GDP and the army of this country and that is a one exemption that we have in the greater Napoli area if you like, the main part of the other portfolio is really in the northern part of Italy, Brescia area where all this wealthy family business is concentrated.

Operator

Before taking the next question which is [indiscernible]. [Operator Instructions]. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.

Unidentified Analyst

I have three short questions, firstly on the restructuring costs that you're expecting for the second half, maybe you could give some indication. Secondly on the margin in new business was around 220 bps in Q2, how do I compare it with the Q1 figure that you said 270 basis points or 230 bps FX cost, I don't want to compare apples with oranges, with which figure do I compare the Q2 220 bps. And thirdly in Italy you are mentioning MPL sales that there is increase interest, does it mean that you’re looking up this opportunity or was it just a general remark to support your statement that the market seems to be bottoming out? Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

If I may start with your last question and in Italy, yes we see an interest increasing interest on NPL sales but the more general remark that I would be surprised if Italian banks are able to do so given the weak documentation that they have normally in place. The reasoning for that is very obvious, most of the Italian banks looked in the past on commercial real estate lending from corporate business, so we have Italian entrepreneur who is developing whatever shopping centers, hotels or offices and has other business with the bank, Italian bank is doing a corporate loan but not taking care on when documentation tenant documentation of the commercial real estate. Now, the commercial real estate is going in the wrong direction and if unpaid by our private equity or hedge fund like to do a deal and then they are simply asking for a tenant schedules and so on. This is so to speak the disconnect for the Italian banks to a certain extend I would expect that they could improve year over time meaning years, but to a certain extent unable to deliver those documentations which are so to speak normal business for us. And hence we are not intending to do unparalleled sales beside those which are in foreclosures and as I said and indicated I would expect that the foreclosure time will shrink average in the past 3 to 4 years and I would expected that will trend significantly. Gross margins compared to 220 or 230 for the full half first half year with 270 gross margin and with respect to restructuring growth, I think on WestImmo with EUR22 million that we already booked in Q2 as it should be done on that end. So no major restructuring costs to be expected with respect to WestImmo in the second half of 2016, but as I said, the full effect of those individual deals will be seen in 2018 and therefore 2017 book will be kind of transitionary period.

Operator

Our final question for today is from the line of Christian Koch at DZ Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Your line is now open.

Christian Koch

I have two questions left, the first one is on floors in your commercial real estate portfolio and the second one is on your expenses. The first one, can you please explain the moving parts of your interest margin regarding floors in your commercial real estate portfolio, if the [indiscernible] space at the current level drop further or rises to 0, and can you please quantify the positive effect regarding floors for the second quarter 2016. And my second question is if I adjust your expenses for the integration costs of EUR30 million, we have a run rate of EUR440 million, can I assume this run rate going forward? Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Thank you for your question with respect to floors, I think we clearly did not profit from the floors until we’ve gone through the 0% [indiscernible] we do not disclose the floor number but you should expect that we have sort of speak two portfolios which one have to look after and one is the treasury portfolio on the asset and liabilities side, this portfolio is respect to below zero coupons well balanced nominal wise and duration wise. So we do not have negative or positive effect on the treasury portfolios. With respect to commercial real estate portfolio, so far the flow of so to speak are offsetting the negative [indiscernible] effect in our commercial real estate portfolio to a large extent. And we have to deduct fixed rates and so on, therefore the calculation is such is little bit complicated. The real positive effect of a [indiscernible] development if you simply look at the commercial real estate portfolio would start to kick in if we have [indiscernible] environment. So that's maybe the best summary on that and with respect to the run rate, the easiest calculation is, if you look into the WestImmo run rate so far before the restructuring effect of some EUR9 million to EUR10 million and the run rate for Aareal and the loan is some EUR110 million just rough numbers, as you may imagine they are some pluses and minuses throughout the quarter, for example in the second quarter 2016 Aareal at 105 because we have some positive effect here that might be in the next quarter some 110 to 130 but average is 110, and WestImmo it is running at 9% to 10%, sorry 9 million to 10 million and this 9 million to 10 million will go down significantly in 2018 as I explained.

We have actually one final question now and that is from the line of Michael Dunst at Commerzbank. Please go ahead Michael. Your line is now open.

Michael Dunst

In terms of the new business models, I have a follow-up question, and so this margin of 220 bps in Q2 and my question is how much based on this definition in the US business, it still around 300 basis points?

Hermann Merkens

Yes, it is quite I so the little bit depending on what we are on boarding and topping gear board, the margins without indication effect in some cases so to speak we are on boarding deals on let’s just figuratively calculate 140, 150 basis points level which are quite very low LTVs, if you're able to syndicate those with [indiscernible] on our portion. So therefore it is little bit so to speak tricky just to look at this gross margin but just as an indicator, we have quite good opportunities in the asset management and if you're doing so to speak low hanging fruit business than we are adding through the indication efforts additional profits here.

Michael Dunst

I'm really hinting at is some, if the margin decline that you have seen 220 bps in the second quarter versus 217 in the first, is this entirely due to mix to the change geographic mix?

Hermann Merkens

Yes it is a changed geographic mix and in the first quarter we've done more or less 100% US business and now we have a more geographic mix with different so to speak deals which we are intent to keep on our balance sheet where the average margin is clearly higher, but as I said, if you could kind of not real but good to be pre-syndicated deals if I may face, where we are able to add on a business fee income through syndication as explained than this would clearly drop the average margin in one quarter but add additional income in the next quarter. So therefore this 220 is a real kind of mixed picture but the drop is more towards the regional composition and in addition we’ve done one or two relatively large deals which I would name low hanging fruit deals but which we intend to syndicate and we will see the benefit for all of it in Q3 or maybe Q4.

Michael Dunst

An very last question with respect to this new business share of 20% for North America in Q2 which compares to 54%, 55% Q1 that’s including the [indiscernible] is the new business mix in terms of so to say newly acquired business the same or is it for North America than the corresponding share is much higher?

Hermann Merkens

All of my at least done 1.2 billion new business in North America and…

Michael Dunst

Is it totally new or newly acquired?

Hermann Merkens

Just the second, 1.2 billion newly acquired, zero prolongation, so to speak that is a full new business contribution of North America. Frankly speaking some 50% of the new business.

Operator

And that was the final question, I will pass the call back to you for any closing remarks.

Hermann Merkens

Thank you very much for your attention and your questions. I think in this volatile environment we are able to confirm our full-year 2016 outlook which I think is signaling that we are doing and moving ahead of our stable business lines and we do not expect our business a major effect from the varied directional where banks could be affected from and thanks for your attention on the call and we will see each other at least on our Q3 call. Thank you very much.
