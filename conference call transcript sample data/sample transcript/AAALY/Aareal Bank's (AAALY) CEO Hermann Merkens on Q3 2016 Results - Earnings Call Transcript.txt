Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Q3 2016 Analyst Conference Call. At our customer’s request, this conference will be recorded. As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions].

May I now hand you over to Mr. Jürgen Junginger, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.

Jürgen Junginger

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. So my name is Jürgen Junginger. I'm heading IR with Aareal Bank and I am not really leading you through this conference call. This will do our CEO, Hermann Merkens. And okay now please start Hermann.

Hermann Merkens

Thank you for the passing over, thanks. So Q3 results I am on Page 2 agenda of today is as usual so we could easily skip to Page 3. Highlights of Q3 2016, overall and successful development Q3 operating profit in line with expectations a little bit above Q3 new business. So we are now catching the upper end of our original guidance with €6 billion. So hence we increase our new business target to €8 billion to €9 billion, but please keep in mind we are trying to steer against our overall portfolio target of roughly €25 billion core business.

Aareon sales and EBIT increased as planned our Aareal 2020 is on track and we raised and you have seen I talked yesterday our profit target to €360 million to €380 million here in as one-off €28 million. So if you deduct that we raise our kind of normalized operating profit target to €330 million to €350 million from €300 million to €330 million.

On Page 4, general environment more or less the same topic with one which is the last bullet of the first paragraph regulatory requirement especially Basel IV still unclear, but clearly in the Q3 call to mention.

For the other topics you are familiar with I think so we could go into Page 6, which is the Q3 at a glance one remark on net interest income and there will be more specific slide later on, €175 million with clean net interest income X one also from early repayments of €171 million. Allowance for credit losses €33 fully in line with full-year target and admin expenses remarkably lower compared to Q2 driven by “just €7 million one-offs from project cost and integration cost”. Operating profit €74 million and earnings per share €0.70.

So now on Page 8, structured property financing, new business roughly €1.56 billion with €1 billion on prolongations and €551 million on new business and in those competitive times one could say that even the prolongations are clear in new business because we have to fight for every single prolongation quite hard. So we’ve been quite comfortable with this number.

New business plan adjusted as I mentioned and target for lower end of the range €25 billion to €27 billion. Gross margins little bit higher than originally expected with 270 bps and 230 bps to 240 bps after FX cost. Year-to-date is just over some 240 basis points after FX, some 211 basis points which is in average higher as originally planned.

With respect to overall transaction volume it’s in the range of the previous quarters, but quite below the previous on a year-on-year basis below the Q3 2015 numbers, so year-to-date heavily down. The overall transaction volume quarter-on-quarter is relatively stable.

If one would step into the areas EU and U.S, and look into the net figures then you see that the private investments in Europe are negative quarter-on-quarter, down on a year-to-date basis negative as well? Public and listed companies are more or less neutral, so investments and disinvestments more or less neutral in Europe and that will also trend in the previous quarter as well. Institutional, the net absorption was positive meaning that the institutional investments were higher than the cash investments.

And cross-border business is a little bit positive, so we've seen in Europe a little bit of an inflow from outside Europe regions. A little bit different picture, neutral for the private investments and negative for the public and listed. So we've seen heavy debt investments from REIT’s and others throughout the last quarter. And that's true form a year-to-date basis on a quarter-on-quarter basis as well.

Institutional investments, well balanced investments and debt investments. And interestingly North India’s the cross-border investments been up on a year-to-date and quarter-on-quarter basis. And that picture which we are clearly closely monitoring because that gives some kind of indication which are the customers classes that we should focus on if you do business in the areas. A little bit of a mixed picture, but overall transaction volume is down on a worldwide basis and that’s true for the EU and U.S. as well which is clearly reflected in our prepayment ratios and in our prepayment fees.

Consulting services were on track, digitization is really feeding in positively, Aareon Smart World is developing according to plan, digital platform which we are developing to really cross link ERP business throughout Europe is well on track should be ready early 2017.

Digital add-on product across countries this program has been intensified and we've been quite proud for the first successes on that. And even the cooperation with a start-up scenario is now really starting to use that again. So the first collaboration with PropTech’s are coming through. Deposit volume is €9.5 billion more or less in line with our expectations, long-term target is €10 billion number.

Page 10, I would skip that it’s simply the break up between consulting - between the deposit business and the Aareon business. Maybe more interesting Page 12, which is a breakdown of the net interest income, €175 million in this quarter as mentioned. And the interesting numbers here is the €154 million, which clearly indicates that although the portfolio has been down the core CRE portfolio has been down from €26.8 million to €25.5 million.

We've been able to keep this net interest income more or less on the same level compared to the previous quarter indicating that our new business margins are now kicking into the balance sheet which are supporting the net interest income line quite nicely.

So on next Page 13, loan loss provision is €33 million. Important remark is that we do not have a new NPL’s in Italy; otherwise we are fully in line with our outlook. Net commission income, I think we elaborated a little bit on that and it's fully in line clearly above the Q3 numbers from 2015 driven by new business support from phi-Consulting, Square DMS from digital products and so on. Admin expenses €127 million, so if you like quite close to the run rate of €120 million if you simply deduct the €7 million one-off number.

And now on Page 17, which is illustrating the RWA development. You see clearly to be expected a number from the non-core business €3 billion down to €2.7 billion which is reflecting the portfolio reduction on that and €600 million number “quarter-on-quarter basis” €11.1 down to €10.6 on the core business which is clearly in effect from minus €1.3 billion of core portfolio reduction on a quarter-to-quarter basis that are so to speak main driver behind that RWA development.

I am now on Page 18, so to speak merits on the capital ratios. We are now on 13.6% common equity Tier 1 ratio mainly driven by this aforementioned RWA effect on the other segments from Q2 calls are still valid, meaning that we have to recognize loan loss provisions as a capital deduction and so on we do not recognize any profits - had not recognize as any profit so far, so all this is - but the main effect here clearly the RWA effect.

On 19, overall portfolio picture on quarter-to-quarter basis and on Page 20 on a year-to-date basis and Page 21, net sable funding ratio, liquidity coverage ratio still on quite nice high levels, so no news here. 22 with our funding activities, we’ve been relatively successful on senior unsecured quite nice long average duration very close to 10 years with relatively low spreads, low issuance from covered bonds really driven by our additions WestImmo and [Coreal] which have supported us in those activities indirectly.

Refinancing situation 23 I think familiar with those pictures which is clearly indicating on the other hand if you look into this light gray that the relative part of the deposits are increasing.

Asset quality on Page 25, average LTV for the portfolio is now 61% that the one remark the other remark North America now with 21% which is as strategically planned dominant part of our portfolio.

On 26, average LTV as already mentioned 61% and I think there was one specific change in Italy. It's now 73% and not 72% I would say it's around 72.5% or something like that. So no major changes here simply somewhat between 72% and 73%.

On 27, our UK portfolio which is down from €4.1 billion to €3.6 billion which is clearly on the one hand simply a currency effect roughly €300 million rest of it are some repayments. I think I indicated that during our Q2 call that we may expect some repayments which now occurred and hence the portfolio is down accordingly. So currently expect €300 million rest of it is our repayments.

Italy is more or less on the same level you would see here and I would comment on the NPLs if we are with NPL slides. Turkey portfolio is down yield on debt as expected and I would expect a further down - slightly downward trend here until year end. This is clearly reflected in the LTV calculation, so we do not have to adjust the LTV calculations because this downward trend was clearly as expected. Predominately part are the hotels in the Istanbul area and I think I guess a more detailed breakdown during our Q2 call.

I’m now with NPL slides Page 30 4.9% which is clearly driven predominately by our Italian portfolio. As you know the increase of the percentage wise increase is not driven by new additions it's simply reflecting somewhat lower portfolio and if you would combine this slide with our NPL portfolio slide from Italy and if you would deduct those loans which are restructured and then we would end up with 3.6% NPL ratio and if you would deduct those loans which are restructured and signed you may remember that on the one hand the action and negotiations with the customer on the other hand one have to wait for stemmed from court.

In some cases if you would deduct those which are not finally stemmed then we would end up with around 3% NPL ratio. And that what I mentioned during our last calls those NPLs which are in those restructuring trends will stay with us typically for longer because the time horizon of those trends somewhat between three and five years. And hence I think it’s a matter of transparency but simply clearly highlight those NPLs which will automatically stay longer with us which are somewhat really restructured. Therefore a little bit more transparency and breakdown of the 4.9%.

Overall coverage ratio now on 31% more or less unchanged, 32% more or less the same picture. And indeed the enforcement period is now really moving down from three to four years more into the two to three-year region or area. Treasury portfolio, 33 is somewhat unchanged, but we sold our small part or rest of our other S portfolio in Q3 and I will reflect that in a comment of the overall spindles lane.

Outlook 2016 that’s on Page 35, €700 million to €740 million net interest income, we are moving towards the €700 million although we are with early repayments on a €32 million number very close to the €35 million, but I wouldn't expect that we would jump into the €75 million full-year region in Q4. So it should be close to the €700 million number.

Allowance for credit losses somewhere between €80 million and €120 million maybe in the middle somewhere. Net commission income €190 million to €200 million somewhere above €190 million and I would expect at admin expenses €520 million to €550 million relatively close to the €550 million which may lead to operating profit of €360 million to €380 million including the one-off or if you exclude the one-off of €28 million, if you exclude that would end up in €330 million to €350 million number.

Pre-tax RoE is 13% including €28 million close to 12%. Excluding the €28 million EPS guidance is relatively unchanged from the one-off effect, reasoning for that is that we had €28 million above in operating profit and around €28 million in our tax line, so that the net effect is somewhat €1 million. So it’s simply reflecting that we are now heading to €330 million to €350 million operating profit.

Target portfolio size, I already mentioned, new business origination increased, operating profit Aareon somewhere between €33 million to €35 million maybe somewhere in the middle. So the overall conclusion is that we've been maneuvering so far successfully through 2016. We've been able to increase our full-year target and more important Aareal 2020 is on track.

So thank you for listening. And now I am happy to take your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Benjamin Goy, Deutsche Bank.

Benjamin Goy

Yes. Good morning. Three questions please from my side. Firstly, at 13.6% CET1 ratio with earnings retention in Q4, you would probably have almost 600 basis points on top of your current ratio and you are very happy to pay up to 70% to 80% dividend for 2017 and 2018. Why wouldn't you do it a bit earlier considering your capital ratios leaving Basel IV aside?

Second question is on your core loan book. How difficult is it to grow it next year in 2017? And then lastly, some more detail on the U.S. LTV continues on a downward trend is now at 63. Is it driven by evaluation effects and/or is your new business at lower LTV at the moment? Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Thank you, Benjamin for your questions. So I may start with the hint towards the high capital ratio clearly as you really - correctly recognized there should be a positive year-end effect if could reflect our profits in the capital ratios. On the other hand rightly hinted there might be an outcome of this ongoing Basel IV debate hence it is a little bit too early to think about dividends and the decision with respect to dividends we will announce that in midst of February as we are always doing.

How easy it would be if we would end up and made Basel IV scenario or no Basel IV scenario to increase our core portfolio. It’s a little bit of relative question whether the risk return on the deals that we are offered is okay in our view. I think there could be room for increasing our core portfolio in 2017. If we would be faced with might Basel IV scenario, no Basel IV scenario - main question from me would be or is clearly at what point in time, this is clear what type of scenario we are in.

But in generally speaking it is clearly the case that we could increase our portfolio. If we want to do so and we are not faced and that was the caveat that you already made which might address or even address Basel IV scenario. With respect to overall U.S. business, I think we have clearly 33% as you’ve already seen back book 53, 33 would be very nice, but I don’t think that we would achieve those margins on that.

But 63 back book LTV new business and renewals are on the 60% LTV level so it’s clearly driven by new business and not that much by revaluation. If you step back a little bit, we reported every repayment especially in 2015 if you remember that, so it’s really a new business which is driving here the LTV in our S portfolio. Hopefully, I touched your questions and hopefully nothing left.

Benjamin Goy

Yes, you did. Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Okay, thanks.

The next question comes from Johannes Thormann, HSBC.

Johannes Thormann

Good morning, everybody. Three questions from my side. First of all looking at your guidance which scenario leads to the lower end of this guidance to the up end and then which case you couldn't reach to beat you guidance as usual? Secondly, could you update us on the outlook if you're looking at targets for consulting and services or will it only be organic growth in this digitalization drive? And last, but not least will that payout ratio for your dividend would be based on your EPS guidance of €3.20 to €3.43 or will you make any adjustments to this. Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Johannes. Thank you for your questions. If I may start with this €330 and €350 we are now very close to the €35 million prepayment and we accounted those prepayment on ratio - fees on a pro rata basis. So if you would see higher repayments in this fourth quarter which would lead to a higher prepayment fees. Then we could end up above this guidance would I really expect this a little bit difficult to predict in the fourth quarter.

We have some events if I may so which could lead to a little bit of a whole pack of investors. We had already one in the U.S., we have this referendum in Italy in the first phase of December. We have section of The Basel Committee end of November if I have that correctly in my head. So really a little bit difficult to predict but as I explained if we would move quite close to the €75 million which I do not expect but then that guidance could be out beaten clearly.

And consulting service targets as you'll see on our slide to consulting services we announced that we are now teaming up with this PropTech and I have one in mind. Meaning that we not necessarily have to invest into start-ups it’s the other way to team up with startup is simply to introduce the idea of start up into our client base.

If the idea is supportive for the processes of our clients that we've been successful in Q3 and I would expect little more on that real investments and start-ups I think it’s always a little bit tricky because you know as a start-up owner, in most of the cases they are looking into value increase and not that much into P&L items. So they hope that will be stock listed quite fast on a very high valuation, so the interests on that is not that easy.

On the other hand there are many around, so it’s the more smarter way to team up with start-up business models. But you're absolutely right, we’re monitoring quite intense whether we could invest on the one or other opportunity in this consulting services area, but it's too early to say something specific on that. And sorry I forgot your last question was a payout ratio.

Johannes Thormann

Yes.

Hermann Merkens

In November, it’s a little bit early to talk about dividends or payout ratios. But general thinking is clearly that I would not necessarily look into payout ratios like on a normal basis. So I wouldn’t necessarily deduct for example Fatburen event from a payout ratio EPS calculation.

Johannes Thormann

So just to be clear, you would not adjust the payout ratio for Fatburen or Coreal effect for this Coreal €28 million.

Hermann Merkens

For the €28 million. It's already adjusted so to speak by our tax regulation if you like, but from a Fatburen basis I would not adjust the payout ratio. But it’s in general too early to say something about payout ratios or dividends.

Johannes Thormann

Okay.

Hermann Merkens

Okay. Thanks.

The next question comes from Britta Schmidt, Autonomous Research.

Britta Schmidt

Yes. Hi there. I have got also three questions please. The first one will be, could you give us an idea about the sensitivity of unit interest income or net interest margin to changes in foreign currency especially the UK pound and maybe you can also give us a sensitivity of your CET1 ratio.

The second question I would have is on the portfolio the slimming down of the portfolio. If that occurs kind of smooth we see at the quarter or the effects that were more at the end of the quarter just to get an idea to how this all recur in the margin is. And then thirdly, should we expect any sort of [indiscernible] or have they already been booked in Q3?

Hermann Merkens

So if I may start with [hector], so we do not have any exposure to hector because we saw that in Q2 2015 or Q3 2015 and I do not have that exactly in my head. So to speak no right back opportunities here. With respect to UK pound as I indicated from a portfolio perspective, as I indicated we've been down on a quarter-to-quarter basis from Q2 to Q3 by €300 million on the portfolio simply a currency effect wise, rest of it was really repayments. So that translates with an average I don't know RWA rating of - let's assume 30% to 35% or something like that into CET1. And third question or fourth question which I didn't touch so far could you repeat that?

Britta Schmidt

I was interested also on the FX impact on the net interest income, if you could give us some sensitivity there? And then other question was just on the portfolio rundown, the decline especially of the core portfolio as to where that was concentrated in a particular month or more with the end of the quarter or thought out the quarter?

Hermann Merkens

I refer to the currency, but I do not expect so much of currency effect on the net interest income, but in our own case for example we had some effect as well which are thousands of euros. So we're not talking about millions, but you may know that they have an exposure to the UK as well. And if I have that correctly, here we had some €300,000 effect which I have now to recover by doing other business. On the core portfolio, it's more or less levered so to speak. I do not have the numbers correctly, but I would expect in Q4 relatively stable 154 or 152 numbers for the core portfolio again.

Britta Schmidt

Thank you.

Hermann Merkens

Thanks, Britta.

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions]

Hermann Merkens

So if there are no other questions as always you could approach us by via e-mail or direct call, we are happy to do that. And thank you for listening and your questions and see you next time at least during road shows or once we are presenting our full-year preliminary figures in midst of February. Thank you very much.

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call is being concluded. You may now disconnect.
