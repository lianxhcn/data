Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Aareal Bank Q3 2024 Investor and Analyst Call. I am Sergen, the Chorus Call operator. [Operator Instructions] The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it’s my pleasure to hand over to Jürgen Junginger, Head of IR. Please go ahead.

Jürgen Junginger

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining today’s conference call. Today’s agenda covers our results for the first 9 months of 2024, together with the outlook for the full year. I am joined today by our CEO, Dr. Christian Ricken; our CFO, Andy Halford; and by our Chief Market Officer, Christof Winkelmann. I am pleased to welcome Andy to his first conference call with us. He joined as CFO as of the beginning of October. Christian, Andy and Christof will take you through our presentation, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.

Now I’m pleased to hand over to Christian. Christian, the floor is yours.

Christian Ricken

Many thanks, Jurgen. Good morning, everyone. And thank you all for attending today’s call. This call takes place against the background of major political developments. As we all know, the clear result of the U.S. Presidential elections and last night, the collapse of the German federal government. I’m very certain that all of us will thoroughly scrutinize the impact of these developments in the foreseeable future and therefore, more than pleased that you are taking the time today to look at our results.

What I can state with certainty is that Aareal Bank has achieved strong results. This is a highly satisfactory performance, especially in light of the challenging market environment in commercial property finance. My colleague, Christof Winkelmann, will talk more about our views on the sector later on. I’m also very pleased to welcome our new CFO, Andy Halford, to his first investors and analyst presentation with Aareal Bank. He will present the figures to you shortly.

Let us begin by taking a look at the key developments in the first 9 months. The bank’s operating profit increased by 19% to more than €260 million, both of the bank’s business segments, Structured Property Financing and Banking & Digital Solutions, BDS, made strong contributions to this result. New business increased substantially in the third quarter, particularly driven by renewals. As a result, new business for the first 9 months matched the previous year’s level.

Margins on new business were also good. Through active management, we also reduced the levels of nonperforming loans. Loan loss charges, excluding those relating to U.S. office, were on normal levels. The bank’s capitalization and liquidity position remains strong and have already been – and we have already completed our 2024 funding plan. We are confirming the operating profit outlook for the bank for the year, even although we expect to absorb one-off charges for efficiency enhancement measures in the fourth quarter.

The key milestone was reached with the closing of the sale of our software subsidiary, Aareon, on the 1st of October. Some transaction-related costs have already been reflected in the results for the first 9 months. The sales proceeds will be recognized in the fourth quarter. The overall gain for the full year is around €2 billion. As I told you, we are looking at consolidated net income for the whole group of around €2.2 billion for 2024 financial year.

As you can see on Slide 3, the sale of Aareon has changed the structure of our group. In short, we have been a financial services group with a banking business and with a strong software subsidiary as an additional segment. Going forward, we will be a bank with 2 strong pillars. The first pillar consists of big ticket commercial property finance, broadly diversified geographically and by sectors.

The second is our payments and deposit-taking business, which is deeply rooted in the housing industry. And we will continue to work very closely with our former software subsidiary, Aareon, even after the sale. Very clearly, Aareal Bank will continue to have a diversified, resilient business model. Our current financial indicators also show how robust our positioning is.

Andy will now give you – will now guide you through our 9-month figures. Andy, over to you.

Andy Halford

Thank you, Christian. I’m very pleased to be taking part in my first conference call with you all. As you just heard, Aareal Bank’s operating performance remains very strong indeed.

Turning to Slide 5. Net interest income was more than €790 million in the first 9 months, which was up 8% year-on-year. This was primarily due to good margins generated in our financing business, a diversified funding mix with improved spreads and the payment and deposit business of our Banking & Digital Solutions segment.

At the start of the year, we established the first financial software joint venture with Aareon in order to better service our customers and provide a long-term platform for our cooperation with Aareon. The commission fees payable to the joint venture are offset against our commission income. Our administrative expenses remained virtually unchanged in the first 9 months, the loan loss charge of €288 million, including valuation adjustments that are included in the fair value result. This was down 9% against the previous year’s figure, but remains at an elevated level due to the challenges presented by the U.S. office property market. Nonetheless, we were able to offset these charges through a sustainable boost to our operating profitability.

Aareal’s total operating profit of €261 million represents a strong 19% increase. Both our business segments have contributed similar amounts to this good result with commercial property finance accounting for €136 million and Banking & Digital Solutions for €125 million. This clearly illustrates the strength of our 2-pillar banking business model that Christian just referred to. The annualized return on equity rose from 6% to 7.4% after taxes. This shows that we are moving in the right direction, but it is also clear that we want to and will boost our profitability further over the coming quarters and years.

Consolidated net income for Aareal Banks Group’s continuing operations amounted to €185 million in the first 9 months. The negative figure of €161 million for discontinued operations, i.e., Aareon, reflects transaction-related costs. As mentioned earlier by Christian, the gain from the sale of Aareon will be recognized in the fourth quarter.

Now let’s take a look at key profit and loss elements on Slide 6. Net interest income came in at just over €790 million for the first 9 months. This increase is mainly driven by the higher average lending volume, good margins on new business and the contributions of our payments business in the BDS segment. Our funding is also a key factor here. We use three funding sources, in particular, funding by the capital markets, the high and very stable level of deposits from the housing industry and retail deposits, which we generate via platforms such as Raisin. This is a well-balanced, broadly diversified funding mix, and I’ll come back to this a bit later.

We managed to keep administrative expenses virtually unchanged. In fact, costs were down slightly in Q3 compared with the previous year. Our cost-income ratio of 32% is very good, also by international standards. However, we have no intention of resting on our laurels rather, we plan to leverage our current high earnings power to further boost our efficiency and ensure we are optimally positioned for the upturn in the sector. Essentially, we will achieve this in 3 ways: by investing in the digital transformation of our processes; by modernizing our IT platforms; and by reducing complexity more generally.

As Christian mentioned at the outset, there will be one-off charges of a mid-double-digit million euro amount for those efficiency enhancement measures, which we will take in the fourth quarter. The bottom line is that we will reduce personnel and non-personnel expenses also by a mid-double-digit million euro amount per year. This will be achieved progressively over the next 3 years.

Before I hand over to Christof, our Chief Marketing Officer, let’s take a quick look at risk provisioning. Even though the overall loss charge of €288 million is currently 9% lower year-on-year, the U.S. office property market does remain depressed. At €160 million provisions on U.S. office properties have continued to account for the majority of the overall charge in the year-to-date. Risk costs for the rest of the portfolio are at reasonably normal levels. Included within these numbers, we have increased the management overlay since the start of the year by €35 million to a total of €60 million.

I would now like to hand over to Christof, who will talk about business developments and commercial property finance in more detail.

Christof Winkelmann

Thank you, Andy. Recently, the business, including the power renewals, has picked up despite market transaction volumes remaining low. In fact, new business of €3.5 billion in the third quarter exceeded the combined volume of the first two quarters. 9 months new business totaled €6.6 billion. This is slightly above the previous year’s level and includes a greater portion of renewals in the mix. We are, therefore, raising our full year target for new business from €8 billion to €9 billion from – I’m sorry, from €8 billion to €9 billion to €9 billion to €10 billion.

However, I would like to emphasize that we will continue to be selective and maintain conservative risk standards. The average loan-to-value ratio for the newly originated business in the first 9 months was at a very respectable 50%. Gross margins were good averaging 280 basis points. The figures show that we are actively making use of these attractive opportunities even in these difficult times.

We continue to finance offices, but only in Europe with very low and, therefore, very good loan-to-value ratios of 48% on average. We do see good opportunities in the European office segment but we’ll continue to ensure that our financings meet our conservative risk standards. Looking at the geographical distribution of new business, our focus does remain on Europe. We have also written new business in the U.S. this year, but on a very selective basis.

In regards to public types, we have been very active in the hotel segment, which, as you know, is a traditional strength of Aareal Bank. The temporary weakness in this asset class during and also after the coronavirus has now been overcome. We never had a doubt that the hotel sector would eventually recover. As it turned out, this happened much faster than many experts expected, opening up good business opportunities for us, which we have used and will use. Hotels are full, even though prices are higher than ever. People want to travel and meet both privately and professionally.

One thing that I have been saying for quite some time now, offices are our second most important asset class in new business. And as I’ve just explained, we are proceeding with caution. The remainder is spread across retail, logistics, student housing and alternative living. As you can see, we are as broadly diversified as ever. Supporting the green transformation of commercial properties remains another key focus of our activities. In the first 9 months of the year, we provided a total of €1.6 billion in newly originated green financings within the scope of our green finance framework. In addition, there was around €0.5 billion in loans that could be reclassified as green, for example, because our clients have achieved relevant certifications or submitted the relevant evidence.

Let’s now turn to the next slide, which shows our current portfolio. The portfolio totaled €31.9 billion at the end of September, which is around €1 billion less than at the end of 2023. However, this was just a snapshot, and we are on track to achieve our year-end target for the portfolio of between €33 billion to €34 billion, one of the reasons why we are confident to raise our new business volume to €9 billion to €10 billion.

As you can see from the two pie charts at the bottom of this slide, our portfolio composition has not changed much compared with the end of 2023. We are still broadly diversified both by probably type and region with a very clear focus on properties in the major metropolitan areas around the globe. There’s temporarily a slight shift in favor of Western Europe, but we will continue to be broadly diversified across both North America and Europe as well as our Asian operations. Our contribution to the green transformation of the property sector has increased significantly. Our green loan portfolio grew by around one quarter compared to the end of 2023 to just about €6 billion.

The next slide tracks two key performance indicators for our performing portfolio. Loan-to-value and yield on debt. Our conservative approach is reflected in these indicators, which have remained at healthy levels. The average loan-to-value of our overall performing portfolio stands at a respectable 56% and this has remained stable compared to the end of 2023. At 63%, even the LTV in the U.S. office asset classes are still solid.

I would also like to highlight the development of yield on debt, i.e., the ratio of properties net income to the amount of the loan. This is a key indicator for us for gauging the properties – profitability relative to the financing structure. Yield on debt on our entire performing portfolio is now at 9.9%, which is a marked improvement on pandemic – pre-pandemic times.

Hotel, shopping centers and logistics properties have particularly good levels here. Strong hotel bookings translate into strong cash flows. And the retail sector has also recovered despite all manner of gloomy predictions. Personally, I do see similarities to the current discussions regarding offices in this asset class. We will and still believe very strongly that there are good long-term opportunities in the office segment. Offices in top locations that have good transport connections and meet high-quality standards, including energy use, will remain an attractive investment.

Slide 12 puts our U.S. office portfolio into context. The U.S. office portfolio at €3.4 billion represents only 11% of our total commercial real estate finance portfolio. At around €750 million, 22% is nonperforming, and this represents 58% of the total NPL. In the first 9 months of the year, loan loss charges, including management overlay relating to U.S. offices amounted to €174 million or to around 60% of the total. For our remaining portfolio risk costs are at normal levels and the NPL ratio is below 2%.

In the following slide, we are showing a more detailed breakdown of our U.S. office portfolio by location and LTVs. As previously mentioned, in the first 9 months, we have not originated any new business in the office sector in the U.S. and have clearly focused on managing our finance office portfolio. Also, we have no intention of withdrawing from this market, and it remains a vital part of our business strategy. Our office exposure currently stands at around €2.7 billion, excluding NPL, but is markedly lower compared to the end of 2023. Our clear focus is on prime locations in the major metropolitan areas and, in particular, in New York City, which remains the most attractive location.

For the vast majority of loans, LTVs have returned to perfectly healthy levels below 60%. We regularly monitor our every single exposure and are in close contact with our client on a daily basis. This is the best way to identify risk at an early stage and to take countermeasures. So what is the way forward in this market? The problems are not completely behind us yet, and we are likely to see additional individual defaults over the coming months. However, my very strong feeling is that we have reached the bottom, and that the market will recover in the first half of 2025. As demonstrated we’re also able to solve and decrease NPL inflows in parallel.

Let’s compare the European office markets to the U.S. office market. The situation is fundamentally different. With our focus on major metropolitan areas such as Paris and London in Europe, we have not seen a single new nonperforming loans since 2022. Loan-to-value ratios are below 60%, with very few exceptions, quite an achievement, I believe, for the portfolio size of roughly €5.1 billion in office financing.

We have pointed out the different market conditions in Europe compared with the U.S. on various occasions. For example, far lower vacancy ratios, longer investment horizons, higher share of equity in the financing structure, shorter commuting distances to name a few. These factors underpin the higher stability of the European office sector.

Let’s now turn to the nonperforming loans. Through active portfolio management, we have already significantly reduced NPLs compared to the end of 2023. NPLs were below €1.3 billion as of the end of September. As of now, we have successfully implemented the additional €300 million NPL reduction that we have previously announced. The stability of our diversified credit portfolio can be seen from the fact that NPLs outside the U.S. office segment only amount to €500 million.

All other markets and regions in our portfolio are performing well. Again, we have had no NPL inflow in Europe office since 2022. This is also visible in our NPE ratio. On the EBIT definition, the ratio stood at 3% at the end of September, below the level of 3.4% as at the end of 2023. We are continuing to active management with our NPL portfolio and aim to reduce NPLs by a further €500 million by about middle of the first quarter. This is in line with our objectives to keep our NPE ratio at or below 3%.

Let me summarize my conclusions. I feel the markets remain challenging, but interest rate cuts have led to things moving again in large parts of the different property markets. Clients are restarting business activity and are engaging across the board, and we have to, and we will. But of course, we will remain as diligent and risk conscious as ever.

On this note, I will hand it back to you Andy.

Andy Halford

Thank you, Christof. Let’s turn to our Banking & Digital Solutions segment on Slide 16, where business with clients from the housing and energy industries has also been very encouraging. At €13.7 billion, the volume of deposits from housing industry clients remained at a high level during the first 9 months of the year, ahead of our original expectation of around €13 billion. The increase in net interest income shows that the decision to expand our payment and deposit business throughout the long zero interest period was strategically correct. Back then, it costs us money. Today, this is an important source of income. Commission income was up 8% to €26 million. However, as I mentioned before, since the start of the year, this is offset by commission expenses paid to First Financial software. These expenses totaled €29 million in the first 9 months.

Moving to Slide 18. This shows our broadly diversified funding mix, which I have already mentioned. Deposits now account for around 45% of our funding volume. In addition to deposits from the housing industry, we obtained retail deposits via platforms like Raisin, which has now reached €3.6 billion. Our capital market funding activities have been equally successful. We placed bonds in Pfandbriefe totaling €2.3 billion during the first 9 months of the year. This included our Aareal Bank’s debut green senior nonpreferred bond, plus 2 benchmark Pfandbriefe issues. It also includes our subordinated Tier 2 bond, which was oversubscribed several times over. With another Pfandbriefe issued in October, we have fulfilled our 2024 funding plan ahead of schedule. There may be additional funding and capital management activities over the coming months depending on market conditions.

Slide 19 focuses on our Pfandbriefe funding, which remains the cornerstone of our overall funding. The mortgage cover pool stands at €16.8 billion diversified across 19 countries and also diversified by asset type. The pool represents first-class mortgage loans and has an average loan-to-value of 34.7%. Moody’s AAA rating relies on an overcapitalization ratio of 16% on a PV basis. Aareal is well ahead of this with a ratio of 19.4% at the end of September.

So turning to the outlook on Slide 22. As Christian mentioned at the outset, given our strong performance in the first 9 months, we confirm our operating profit target of €250 million to €300 million for the 2024 financial year. This is after recognition of expected one-off charges for efficiency enhancement measures in the fourth quarter that we mentioned earlier.

In addition, the sales proceeds from the sale of Aareon will be booked in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year’s net gain from the transaction to around €2 billion. Together with the results generated by the bank, this translates into consolidated net income of approximately €2.2 billion after taxes.

And for the key takeaways, I’ll now hand back to Christian.

Christian Ricken

Yes. Thank you, Andy. Now allow me to sum up. I think firstly, Aareal Bank is a healthy, financially robust bank. We have a strong balance sheet and industry-leading capital ratios. We have a diversified business model with two strong, high-yielding and resilient segments. We have made good progress in resolving problematic U.S. office loans. Our other loans are performing normally. And we are investing in our efficiency and future viability. Overall, we are very well positioned for further profitable growth.

So thank you very much for your attention. Andy, Christof and I are very happy to answer your questions. And with that, I hand it back to Jurgen.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have the first question from Shanawaz Bhimji from ABN AMRO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Shanawaz Bhimji

Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks, operator. And hi, guys. Thanks for the presentation and congratulations on the good results. Two questions from my side. You mentioned the high debt yields on new business. And from my understanding, hotels by nature have a higher degree of variability in rents than that, for example, offices, but also generate higher rent per square meter. So my question would be at what kind of occupancy was the hotel exposure structured? So with that 10% be at, let’s say, 70% on average vacancy level? Or would that 10% that you will see on, let’s say, assuming that the hotel will be fully occupied 24/7?

And then my next question is about some encouraging data I see, for example, in U.S. offices, the new track attendance data. And particularly in New York/Manhattan, they are seeing back to office, so I think attendance there is already above 70%. So just wondering whether this also translates into better bids for properties and at the end of the day also maybe for loans? And if there’s any chance for you to maybe already exit these loans by secondary sell-down should appetite have indeed improved? That’s it.

Christof Winkelmann

Yes. This is Christof speaking. Thank you for your questions. As it relates to the occupancy hotels, fortunately or unfortunately, it depends on how you see it. There is not a one rule for occupancy and resulting debt yields, depends on whether you have a seasonal resort or a business hotel in a city or a conference hotel which varies at time. I would say that mostly hotels will ultimately look at having occupancy anywhere between 70% – 65%, 70% to 85%, 90%. There are outliers that will run close to 100%. There are resorts that will be more likely to have maybe 40%, 50%, depending on how you calculate it, whether you do it on the days in a year or the open days in the year. So that is how we would look at it. So there’s no one size fits all, but city center hotels will tend to have a higher occupancy than a resort, for example. I think that’s something that I could say.

When we look at the New York office market, what we have seen over the past months and weeks is that we have seen a higher demand and higher visitation for vacant space. We have also seen rents slowly coming back up again, not to the point where it used to before COVID that would only happen in absolute Prime 1A new buildings, but also for other buildings, rents are slowly increasing. And as I said, I think the visitation and actual signature of leases is slowly increasing. I think there’s still a good way to go to say that New York is out of the shadow. But the good thing is there is some light at the end of the tunnel. And as I have mentioned before and I think we have hit the rock bottom. So, when you ask me, does this translate into easier sales, ultimately it will. This always takes time because values don’t adjust because of one lease. But the tendency is that when leases are signed, which they currently are, market value will increase, and that is also not only dependent upon the leases and occupancies, but also on the interest levels going forward. I think one thing was a very good turning point, namely no further increasing interest rates. They have no decrease. And as to whether they will further decrease or not, this is a bit of looking at the crystal ball. But I think the surety or the general perception is that interest rates won’t increase. So, that gives much more planning visibility. And if you have the thought that interest rates might decrease a bit more than you might consider as an investor buying today and then making use of better interest rates going forward. So, all-in-all, we would expect trading volume in also New York going up and much closer in terms of bid and ask pricing.

Shanawaz Bhimji

Yes, that’s clear. So, the second part, maybe coming back to the first question, so if I hear from you anywhere between 70% and 85% vacancy, that means that the loan would be structured on that level because I was just wondering whether the debt yields you are showing is basically on the back of the current trends and the current income the operator is making that might – because of seasonal influences of January because of the high demand, maybe still from the pandemic create an artificially high debt yield. But am I hearing you correctly that you would structure this at roughly between 70% and 85% vacancy level?

Christof Winkelmann

It is not vacancy level, it is occupancy. The other way around, more difficult maybe, but we will see. Look, if you – this would take a long time. I could guide you through how a structure would be as – the loan will be structured on a resort hotel versus a city center hotel. City center hotel tends to have one month or two months of the year, that are lower and the rest higher, whereas some of the resorts, if it’s a ski resort, more so in the winter high occupancy, low occupancy in summer. So, the structures that we do will cater for fluctuating cash flows within a hotel. We do a lot of management agreements, so there is no fixed lease income, so we are structuring according to that. And as you have seen throughout the past 4 years, I think we have structured them in a way that they can sustain quite some downturn and cash flow volatility. And to your point, is it now going back down because people spend all the money. I think that was the initial thought of many people in the industries and interested in this, we have not seen that. And whilst everybody is complaining about un-payable or very, very high room rates compared to we speaking, hotels are still very full. So, they might not be growing at a 20% RevPAR growth per year anymore and come back to a normal growth of 3% to 5%. But I think that’s where we currently are, and we do not see any reason for cash flows collapsing or coming down in the distant or close future. So, I think that hopefully answers your question.

Shanawaz Bhimji

Thanks guys.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from the line of Corinne Cunningham from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Corinne Cunningham

Good morning everyone. Let me start and starting with capital, please. Could you explain why capital or CET1 dipped in the quarter, I see your RWAs are up, but if you can perhaps give us a bit more detail there? And then also in terms of your thinking or longer term thinking about how to use the Aareon sale proceeds, what kind of CET1 or coverage levels for NPLs should we be thinking about for ‘25, ‘26? And then on the non-performing loans, you talked about two new ones, were those both U.S. office and could you explain it? It looks to me like the overlay tick down in Q3 from 68% to 60%, did I read that right? Thank you.

Andy Halford

Okay. Let me just pick those up. So, the capital level just fractionally below where it was at Q2, yes, but honestly, capital levels do move around by a few basis points between quarters depending upon the flow of new business and non-performing loans and things like that. So, I wouldn’t read too much into an intra-quarter movement. We have been at or just slightly above the 19% level now for really quite a long period of time, and that is clearly a high percentage by industry standards, and one which I think gives confidence that we are extremely well capitalized. Your second question on the Aareon proceeds, I mean our guiding light here, I guess is we need to make sure that we are running a well-capitalized bank that is good and strong on liquidity. We think we tick both of those boxes very strongly at the moment. If we have excess, then in conjunction with discussions with our regulators, obviously, we will look to return what we can do whilst remaining strong, both on capital liquidity. Third question was on non-performing loans, the two loans there were U.S. office and from Europe [ph]. So, one was, one wasn’t, I think is the answer to that. And your fourth question – sorry, just remind me your fourth question?

Corinne Cunningham

It was just about the movement in management overlay.

Andy Halford

Management overlay, yes. So, it’s down on the quarter, but it is up 35% on the year. So, again quarterly, cut by quarter, it’s probably a similar answer to your first question. We go through. We look at areas where we feel that a little bit of a judgment needs to be applied. And this time, there were a couple of areas where we felt we needed a slightly less overlay. So, 68% – the previous quarter became 60% this time around, but look that over three quarters, 25% has gone up to 60%. So, it’s moved up over the course of the year, but down a fraction in Q3 itself.

Corinne Cunningham

Thank you very much.

Operator

There are no more questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jürgen Junginger for any closing remarks. Wait, we have a last minute registration from Domenico Maggio from Jefferies. Please go ahead sir.

Domenico Maggio

Hi everyone. Thank you for taking the question and I joined the call late, so apologies if you already answered this question. One would be on your – you announced today that you have up to €500 million NPL for resolution. I was wondering, are these – am I right to assume that these are entirely U.S. – regards to U.S. office? The second question would be you confirmed your full year guidance on operating profit at €250 million to €300 million. I see the nine months are at €261 million, so should I expect some lower operating profit in Q4, possibly a one-off charge or do you expect possibly to go above your guidance? And you mentioned previously maybe not to be too fast on the Q-on-Q move on capital. But I noticed out the phased-in capital and fully loaded capital have opposite moves. So, if you can give us some color on that, that would be great. Thank you.

Christof Winkelmann

This is Christof. I will take the €500 million question in regards to the content. So, we are confident to solve about €500 million worth of NPL until, as I said, the middle of the first quarter. And it is to the majority in North America, in the U.S. on office, but there is also some of it that we are still working on in Europe because we don’t want to let Europe completely out of sight. So, the €500 million would in majority be earmarked for the U.S. portfolio, but a small portion would be for some existing European NPLs, which we are also working on resolving.

Andy Halford

Let me take your second question, €250 million to €300 million operating profit, that’s the pre-existing guidance which we have reaffirmed. We said there will be some charges in the fourth quarter for the efficiency program, which we have sort of put at a few tens of millions of euros. But obviously, we will be specific about that in due course, so current run rate, less a bit of charge for that. And then I guess the unpredictable is always the loan loss charges for the period. And I guess the working hypothesis is probably seen Q4 somewhere around the Q3 level or somewhere of that order. And that would all put you back into the sort of €250 million to €300 million range. If we can exceed it, don’t worry, we will do. But that’s sort of the range that we have set our sights. Sorry, your third question was?

Domenico Maggio

On the opposite movement on capital, if you – on Q-on-Q, if you check the fully loaded versus the phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio…

Andy Halford

Yes. Okay. So, what we have got is a pretty static overall high level of phased in CET1 19.3%. I think we have been up at that level now for a couple of years. The fully loaded base has gone up from about 13.5% at the end of last year to 15.25% now. That is primarily a result of the technical one of the inclusion of an SME factor that now can be taken into account. So, that is the primary reason for – to that increase. But I think the key one is sort of like a 4 percentage point delta between the fully phase – to the phase-in numbers. We are on both phases very well capitalized.

Domenico Maggio

Okay. Thank you. It sounds like you already answered the most of my questions. Thank you for repeating.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Barrington [ph]. Please go ahead.

Good morning. Thank you. So, I just got three quick questions. So, thank you for the LTV on newly acquired business, but I just wanted to ask what was the LTV on renewals, and when it comes to renewal, I guess how much equity did the sponsors put in for those deals? Second question was on the office new business that you have done for the year, I guess how much of that is in U.S. offices? And my last question, can you give us any color or any indication of what is the maturity wall for 2025 in terms of the business in terms of loans coming back to you? Thank you.

Christof Winkelmann

I will ask you for the second question, again. The first one, I understood. So, when it comes to the split of new business versus prolongations, for the first three quarters, we will be at 80% for the new business and around 300 basis points for the prolongation. When it comes to the maturity wall or maturities coming up, I think it’s a pretty normal year. We easily have repayment ratios anywhere between 10% to 20% that depends on the economic cycle and also the success of having underwritten loans in any certain year. We have done more or less, but there is no wallet is higher or lower than what we usually would have in our ongoing business. And to your second question, if you would just repeat that, please?

It was around how much of the office – the new office business you have done for the year is from the U.S.?

Christof Winkelmann

Zero. It’s a very easy question.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay. What was the LTV on the renewals?

Christof Winkelmann

The renewals LTV, give me one second, the renewals was at just above 60%, 62%.

The next question comes from the line of Wilhelm Johannis from PGIM Fixed Income. Please go ahead.

Wilhelm Johannis

Hi. Just on the NPL sales, with the €300 million sale that’s been completed now, you had fully provisioned that head of during this quarter and you don’t have that same guidance for the €500 million. So, do you have any thoughts around kind of additional charges you might have to deal with when selling that? Thanks.

Christof Winkelmann

Yes, indeed. Those €500 million have been fully provisioned to our best knowledge at this point in time.

Wilhelm Johannis

Okay. Thanks.

There are no more questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jürgen Junginger for any closing remarks.
